
#### Introduction

This is the new repo for a creative-commons book I've written called 'Essential JavaScript Design Patterns For Beginners'. Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software development and are a very useful tool to have at your disposal. To read the latest version online at any time see: http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/

#### Why is this needed?

I wanted to write this mini-book was because I felt that patterns were an area a lot of new and intermediate JavaScript developers may not have had a chance to explore just yet and I'm hopeful my book will encourage you to check them out as they can be quite powerful.

#### Reporting Issues or content requests

For any issues related to EJDP, please feel free to open up an issue through the repo. I'll be regularly checking the blog comments and making weekly updates as time allows but trackable issues through github are preferred.

Thanks and I hope this comes in useful.
