
#### Introduction

This is the repo for an in-progress creative-commons book I've written called 'Essential JavaScript Design Patterns'. Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software development and are a very useful tool to have at your disposal. You can read the latest version [online](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/ "Read Online") at
any time. 

Version 1.5 of the book is currently over 100 A4 pages in length and 1.0 was downloaded approximately 260,000 times (rounded) during 2011. I've temporarily removed additional formats of the book while I wrap up 1.5.1 and consider moving it to a more automated process of conversion, but they'll be back soon!.

#### Why is this book needed?

I wanted to write this book as I felt that patterns were an area a lot of new and
intermediate JavaScript developers may not have had a chance to explore just yet and I'm hopeful my book will encourage you to check them out as they can be quite powerful.

#### Reporting Issues or content requests

For any issues related to EJDP, please feel free to open up an issue through the repo. I'll be
regularly checking the blog comments and making weekly updates as time allows but trackable issues through github are preferred.

Thanks for reading and I hope this comes in useful.
